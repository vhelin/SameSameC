   BILIBALI - Yet Another ANSI C89 Like Language Cross Compiler For 8-bit CPUs
                          Written by 2021 Ville Helin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is currently under development, and hosted in a private repository. So
you should not be able to read this. :) Public release comes when it's working
well enough. BILIBALI is GPL v2 software. Read the LICENSE file for more
information. Some pieces of code were taken from WLA DX, but not so many.

I will not approve pull requests as I want to do this myself. Up to the point
when I decide I've had enough. :) Ideas, bug reports and feature requests are
welcome, though.


TODO
----

Optimize:

- Optimize user written calculations like 2+a-1 -> 1+a
- If a variable is only written to, remove the variable and all assignments
- Z80: Keep stack frame in IX and possibly IY all the time
- Local array variable initialization

Fix:

- Currently "data[i++] += 1;" increments i twice...

Add:

- Add support for struct {};
- Add support for #if, #elif, #else and #endif
- Add support for free const strings
- Add support for static variables and functions


NOTE
----

Programmed using:

- emacs

Should compile anywhere ANSI C89 is supported.
